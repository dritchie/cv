\maketitle


Interactions with students have provided some of the most rewarding experiences of my academic career thus far, and the desire to teach and mentor is a major motivation behind my pursuit of a faculty position.
My experience makes me well-qualified to teach courses on a variety of computer graphics topics, as well as select artificial intelligence topics such as probabilistic modeling and inference. I am interested in developing new courses that straddle the boundaries of these and other disciplines, especially courses on probabilistic programming and the use of probabilistic modeling in computer graphics.

At Stanford, I have served as a teaching assistant for both the introductory computer graphics course (CS 148) as well as the advanced graduate course on physically-based rendering (CS 348b). In these roles, my responsibilities ranged from designing new assignments to giving lectures to developing online course infrastructure. At UC Berkeley, I was also a teaching assistant for the introductory graphics course (CS 184), where I focused much of my effort on running small group discussion sections. I also served on the teaching staff for UCBUGG, an entirely student-run course on the principles of modern computer animation.


\section*{Teaching Philosophy}

\textbf{Ownership}:
In my experience, students feel more engaged with and more pride in their work when they feel ownership over it. Thus, in courses I teach, I prefer programming assignments that permit multiple implementation possibilities, rather than extensive frameworks into which students fill in a few pieces. As a teaching assistant for Stanford's CS 148 introductory graphics course, I designed a new raytracing assignment along these lines, providing students with a 3D scene description format and parser but allowing them to design the rest of their code however they saw fit. For the same reason, I also prefer courses that feature open-ended final projects. Two classes that I have been involved in teaching, CS 184 at UC Berkeley and CS 348b at Stanford, have done so. In both cases, the teaching staff provided students with suggested project ideas, but we also strongly encouraged students to develop their own ideas, helping them in office hours to flesh out and appropriately scope such projects. In addition to fostering a sense of ownership, this process helps students develop an intuition for what constitutes a significant-but-doable contribution, which is a useful skill for young researchers.

\textbf{Collaboration}:
Every course should involve some amount of group work, especially for bigger, term-end projects. In my experience, nearly all real work requires group efforts, whether in engineering or in research, so it is critical for students to learn effective collaboration skills. Collaboration can also take the form of peer teaching and learning. In the small discussion sections I led as a CS 184 teaching assistant, and throughout my time teaching UCBUGG, I saw the value of having students learn from each other. Teaching new material to others helps students solidify their own understanding. Students are often more comfortable asking questions of their peers, whom they see as less intimidating than a professor. And practicing peer-to-peer learning in school is excellent preparation for the workplace, where official `teachers' rarely exist.

\textbf{Communication}:
I will make it a priority, both as a teacher and research mentor, to develop my students' ability to communicate the results of their work. I have often been frustrated by the lack of emphasis on communication in Computer Science curricula. In courses I have taken, as well as in those I have helped teach, project reports and presentations have often been treated as obligatory milestones. My courses will include active instruction on how to present work in both written and oral form. This includes empathizing with the audience (``To whom am I presenting, and what do they know?'') and establishing concrete communication goals (``What key points should the audience take away from this section?''). I am particularly interested in exploring peer evaluation of paper drafts and practice talks in my courses, something that has been a fixture of my research lab at Stanford. 


\section*{Example Courses}

\textbf{Introduction to Computer Graphics (undergraduate)}:
A first course in computer graphics, covering a broad range of fundamental concepts in the area. Students will become familiar with 3D geometry representations, 3D transformations, color spaces, image manipulations, simple light reflectance models, and basic raytracing, among other topics. The course is strongly practical, featuring multiple short programming assignments and an open-ended final project. This class design is based on my experience TAing CS 148 and CS 184 at Stanford and Berkeley, respectively.

\textbf{Interactive Computer Graphics (undergraduate)}:
A second course in computer graphics, focused on building usable, interactive graphics applications. Students will learn the fundamentals of real-time rendering pipelines and become fluent in programmable shading languages. They will be exposed to different methods for camera control, animation, and content creation, including procedural techniques such as noise and fractal terrain. The course culminates with the presentation of a long-term group project to build an interactive visualization, design tool, or game using WebGL. This class is based on my experience TAing CS 184 at Berkeley, as well as my experience building WebGL applications for my own research.

\textbf{Research Topics in Probabilistic Programming (graduate)}:
This advanced graduate-level course covers both foundational and recent work on probabilistic programming languages. Students will read and discuss seminal and new papers from the probabilistic programming literature. They will also complete a long-term research project in the area: motivating and building a new probabilistic language, improving inference algorithms in an existing language, or improving the computational efficiency of an existing language. The course aims to attract and facilitate collaboration between students of artificial intelligence, machine learning, programming languages, and compilers.

\textbf{Probabilistic Modeling and Inference for Computer Graphics (graduate)}:
This graduate-level course covers recent work at the intersection of probabilistic modeling and computer graphics. Students will read and discuss papers that apply probabilistic methods to 3D object modeling, environment modeling, color selection, surface appearance, lighting, and animation. Accompanying this discussion, students will prepare peer presentations to explain the mathematical methods used, such as graphical models, probabilistic grammars, and Monte Carlo sampling-based inference. The course culminates with an open-ended project in which students develop inference-based machinery for a novel graphical design tool.
