\section{EMPLOYMENT}

\employer{\textbf{Research Intern}}
\title{\textsc{Adobe Creative Technologies Lab}}
\dates{Summer 2011}
\location{San Francisco, CA}
\begin{position}
Mentored by Mira Dontcheva. I investigated the creative process for webcomic artists, identified the early planning/layout phase as an opportunity for computational assistance, and prototyped a tablet-based tool for quick composition and manipulation of rough thumbnail sketches. My work resulted in a patent for new methods of creating digital comics.
\end{position}

\employer{\textbf{Technical Director Intern}}
\title{\textsc{Pixar Animation Studios}}
\dates{Summer 2009}
\location{Emeryville, CA}
\begin{position}
I worked on and am credited in the short film ``Day and Night.'' I co-developed the film's pipeline for integrating 2D-animated characters into 3D scenes, and I also optimized the rendering of shots featuring hundreds of instances of desert vegetation. In addition, I wrote tools that allowed Pixar's in-house volumetric renderer to work with volumetric effects authored in Houdini.
\end{position}

\employer{\textbf{Software Intern}}
\title{\textsc{Hewlett-Packard}}
\dates{Summer 2008}
\location{Roseville, CA}
\begin{position}
I prototyped an application for user authentication and permissions management on enterprise networked print devices.
\end{position}


\section{TEACHING \& MENTORING}

% Going to abuse some commands here...

\employer{\textbf{Teaching Assistant}}
\title{\textsc{Stanford CS 348b:}}
\dates{Spring 2014}
\location{Stanford, CA}
\begin{position}
\textsc{Image Synthesis Techniques}\\
I held office hours, evaluated student work, and advised students on open-ended final projects for this graduate-level course on advanced physically-based rendering techniques.
\end{position}

\employer{\textbf{Research Mentor}}
\title{\textsc{Stanford CURIS Program}}
\dates{Summer 2013}
\location{Stanford, CA}
\begin{position}
I mentored an undergraduate student as part of the Stanford CS Undergraduate Research Internship (CURIS) program. The student, Ben Mildenhall, developed a system for `Bayesian Policy Search,' using Markov Chain Monte Carlo to infer high-reward policies for simple 2D game agents. Ben later contributed to my SIGGRAPH 2015 paper, and he is now a Ph.D. student at UC Berkeley.
\end{position}

\employer{\textbf{Teaching Assistant}}
\title{\textsc{Stanford CS 148:}}
\dates{Fall 2011}
\location{Stanford, CA}
\begin{position}
\textsc{Introduction to Computer Graphics and Imaging}\\
For this course, in addition to my office hours and grading responsibilities, I also designed a new raytracing assignment from the ground-up and gave a guest lecture on raytracing.
\end{position}

\employer{\textbf{Teaching Assistant}}
\title{\textsc{UC Berkeley CS 184:}}
\dates{Fall 2009, Spring 2010}
\location{Berkeley, CA}
\begin{position}
\textsc{Foundations of Computer Graphics}\\
I led student discussion sections for this introductory computer graphics course, where I designed small group activities, gave mini-lectures, and discussed the nuts and bolts of programming assignments.
\end{position}

\employer{\textbf{Student Facilitator}}
\title{\textsc{UCBUGG}}
% \dates{December 2008 -- May 2010}
\dates{Spring 2009, Fall 2009, Spring 2010}
\location{Berkeley, CA}
\begin{position}
For three semesters, I was part of the leadership team for the UC Berkeley Undergraduate Graphics Group (UCBUGG), an entirely student-run program that helps students learn the principles of 3D animation and guides them through the creation of their first animated short film. I designed exercises, gave lectures, and provided technical support for 3D software such as Maya.
\end{position}

\employer{\textbf{Tutor}}
\title{\textsc{UC Berkeley Self-Paced Center}}
\dates{Fall 2008}
\location{Berkeley, CA}
\begin{position}
I tutored students at UC Berkeley's Computer Science Self-Paced Center, an organization offering university-recognized courses that allow self-directed students to learn a new programming language at their own pace.
\end{position}


% \section{SERVICE}


\section{OPEN-SOURCE SOFTWARE}

\textbf{WebPPL} \\
\url{http://webppl.org} \\
I am one of the main contributors to WebPPL, a state-of-the-art probabilistic programming language that uses continuation passing style to support enumeration-based, sampling-based, and variational inference algorithms. I have also used WebPPL to implement an open-source demo of my Stochastically-Ordered Sequential Monte Carlo algorithm that runs entirely in the browser (\url{http://dritchie.github.io/web-procmod}).
\\ \\
\textbf{probabilistic-js} \\
\url{https://github.com/dritchie/probabilistic-js} \\
I am the author of probabilistic-js, a lightweight embedding of probabilistic programming in Javascript. Like WebPPL, probabilistic-js can run in-browser, and it is the inference engine behind the online course \emph{Probabilistic Models of Cognition} (\url{https://probmods.org}).
\\ \\
\textbf{Quicksand} \\
\url{http://dritchie.github.io/quicksand/} \\
I am the author of Quicksand, a lightweight embedding of probabilistic programming in the high-performance Terra language. Quicksand uses Terra's metaprogramming and code-generation constructs to compile fast machine code for MCMC inference on probabilistic programs.
